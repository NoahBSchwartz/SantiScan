  1. #### On-Device Actions
     - The ESP32-CAM captures and saves a video to its SD card each time the sanitizer is dispensed
     - When the user walks away, each of these 15 frames is uploaded to a Google Colab notebook
  
  2. #### Data Cleaning
     - A machine learning algorithm, [Mediapipe](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/face_mesh.html), locates each joint of the hand
     - These 20 points are used to perfectly mask the hand from its background using the [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything.git) approach
  
  3. #### Hand Recognition
     - Now that every frame only contains data about the palm,
     - dd
  
  4. #### Data Display

## ðŸŽ‰ Result
The final product is compact enough to look and function exactly like a normal automatic soap dispenser. The only changes are a small maintenance port and 3 switches on the backside of the device.

This product was a collaboration between the Computer Science and Biomedical programs at County High. The biomedical engineers came up with the project idea, validated, researched, and grounded their claims in scientific studies. I was responsible for the full software and hardware development.
